# soundcloud_saver


This repository does not contain a soundcloud client id. To run it, you must register a new app in the soundcloud developer console. Once this has been done, create a file `secrets.py` in this directory, and set the client_id in it as so:

CLIENT_ID="xxx"

where xxx = the client id for your new app.
